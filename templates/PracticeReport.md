# Pentesting Practice Report

## Executive Summary
Provide a high-level overview of the pentest engagement, including the purpose, scope, findings, and recommendations.

## Introduction
Briefly introduce the HackTheBox machine tested, including its name, IP address, operating system, and difficulty level.

## Scope
Define the scope of the pentest engagement, including the target systems, networks, and services covered.

## Methodology
Outline the methodology used during the pentest, including the enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation techniques employed.

## Findings
### Vulnerabilities Exploited
List and describe the vulnerabilities exploited during the engagement, including their impact and severity.
- Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection in web application
  - Description: Exploited a SQL injection vulnerability in the login form.
  - Impact: Able to extract sensitive information from the database.
  - Severity: High

### Privilege Escalation
Detail the privilege escalation techniques used to elevate privileges on the compromised system.
- Exploit Used: DirtyCow
  - Description: Exploited the DirtyCow kernel vulnerability to gain root access.
  - Impact: Achieved full control over the system.
  - Severity: Critical

### Post-Exploitation Activities
Describe any post-exploitation activities performed after gaining initial access to the target system.
- Installed Backdoor:
  - Description: Planted a backdoor shell script in /tmp directory.
  - Impact: Maintained persistence on the system.
  - Severity: Medium

## Recommendations
Provide recommendations for mitigating the identified vulnerabilities and improving the overall security posture.
- Patch Management: Regularly apply security patches and updates to all systems and software.
- Web Application Security: Implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Privilege Separation: Limit user privileges and restrict access to sensitive system files and directories.
